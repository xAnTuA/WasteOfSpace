## Couplers
### Couplers as doors
Should be in certain size for ease of getting from one module to another
| SIZE          |   Shortcut    |   Size            |
| :------------ | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| Small         | S             | 6x6               |
| Medium        | M             | 12x12             |

###Couplers that dont work as an doors
Any size, smaller harder to hit but harder to couple. So i recomend doing 1x1 stud when it doesnt need to be smaller
