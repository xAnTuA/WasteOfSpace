# Connecting modules

inside every module if we want to continue network, we need to add wire, chute, pipe, networkcable, by doing so we are able to add any module anywhere without the need of connecting them manually,
if the module is dead end, it doesnt need to implement any of the these.

by doing wiring in this way we, do not thing what module will be connected next, it might not use any of the wiring at all, but still if we connect module that use it will connect quickly, and seamlessly, creating ultimate network access

the problem arised by doing so:
if somebody attach an antena or sth else, if they know there is wire in the cender they might stole all energy from ship

solution:
create switches so we can controll the flow of energy / etc.

problem it creates:
we need better sub-networking so we can controll flow, making more parts needed per module
